  <p class="about">
    Seven billion people are on this Earth, and everybody is different from the rest of others. There is nothing without purpose in this world. Everything has some purpose. Humans are the best creation, and each person is exclusive. Thus, writing about myself, Iâ€™m here to express myself that what I see, what I experience and what I plan for my life. I try myself to be modest, passionate, devoted, hardworking and honest.

  <p class="about">
    You are the only one who knows yourself best. Everyone around you has different things to tell about you, but only you know your true self. There are billions of people on this planet, and every person has a different purpose. Each person finds their mission differently and has a different journey. Thus, when I write about myself, I write about my journey and what makes the person I am because of the trip. I try to be myself, be passionate about my dreams and hobbies, live honestly, and work hard to achieve all that I want to make.

  <p class="about">
    Each person has different hobbies, and doing different things gives them joy. Baking is something that gives me comfort and helps me relax. I tried baking after entering college. At first, it was a little stressful, but then I started learning more and more. After a hectic day at college, it helps to relax you. Another thing that helps me relax is reading books. I started reading books when I was in school, and over the years, the habit is something that has helped me learn a lot.
